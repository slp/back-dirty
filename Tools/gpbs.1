.SH NAME
gpbs \- GNUstep PasteBoard Server 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpbs
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B gpbs
daemon serves as a clipboard/pasteboard for GNUstep programs, 
handling the copying, cutting and pasting of objects as well as 
drag and drop operations between applications.
.P
Every user needs to have his own instance of 
.B gpbs
 running. While
.B gpbs
will be started automatically as soon as it is needed, 
it is recommend to start
.B gpbs 
in a personal login script like ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc. 
Alternatively you can launch gpbs when your windowing system or the 
window manager is started. For example, on systems with X11 you can launch
.B gpbs
from your .xinitrc script or alternatively
- if you are running Window Maker - put it in Window Maker's autostart script. 
See the 
.I GNUstep Build Guide 
for a sample startup script.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
To attach 
.B gpbs
to a remote session use the 
.I -NSHost <hostname> 
argument.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B gdomap -L GNUstepGSPasteboardServer
will lookup instances of 
.B gpbs.
.P
Alternatively, 
.B gdomap -N
will list all registered names on the local host.
.P
.SH BUGS
Versions of
.B gpbs
up to (including) 1.7.2 have problems with copy and paste of
mulit-lingual text, as it used the atom XA_STRING alone to
exchange string data between X clients (and thus GNUstep clients).  
This means
.B  gpbs
is inherently unable to do cut-and-paste with characters 
other than ISO Latin1 ones, TAB, and NEWLINE.
