       The  gpbs  daemon  serves  as  a  clipboard/pasteboard for
       GNUstep programs, handling the copying, cutting and  past-
       ing of objects as well as drag and drop operations between
       applications.

       Every user needs to have his own instance of gpbs running.
       While  gpbs will be started automatically as soon as it is
       needed, it is recommend to start gpbs in a personal  login
       script  like  .bashrc  or .cshrc.  Alternatively you could
       launch gdnc when X11 is started or - if  you  are  running
       Window  Maker  -  put  it Window Maker's autostart script.
       See the _G_N_U_s_t_e_p _B_u_i_l_d _G_u_i_d_e for a sample startup script.
