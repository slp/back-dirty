1.1 Noteworthy changes in version `0.11.0'
==========================================

Bugfixes to art and xlib.

There was some work on the Windows backend for the GDI interface by
Christopher Armstrong.

1.2 Noteworthy changes in version `0.10.3'
==========================================

Fixes. A lot of Cairo backend work.

1.3 Noteworthy changes in version `0.10.2'
==========================================

The Backend can set UTF8 window titles where this is allowed.

1.4 Noteworthy changes in version `0.10.1'
==========================================

The art graphics module is the default now. As was previously the case,
if the proper libraries are not found, the configuration will
automatically switch to xlib on winlib (whichever is appropriate).

   There was a great deal of work by Tom MacSween on the windows module
to get windows and taskbars working together, closing, opening, hiding,
and just general good window management.

   The Cairo module has been significantly updated and now works with
Cariro version 1.0, although you need to make some minor changes to the
Cairo library before it will work with GNUstep. Due to this, this module
is still considered beta. Ask on the mailing lists for help with this.

1.5 Noteworthy changes in version `0.10.0'
==========================================

The installed name of the backend now includes an interface version
number.  This avoids the potential version mismatch between the
frontend (GUI) library and the backend.

   * Alpha blending was implemented for Windows, although it does not
     seem to work on some machines.

1.6 Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.5'
=========================================

   * Added support for window alpha on X servers.

   * Add support for old and new freetype libs.

   * Some improvements to the Windows backend.

1.7 Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.4'
=========================================

   * Fast drawing on 8 bit displays was added (although it might only
     speed things up on old X11 servers and/or remote servers).

   * GNUstep modifier keys are mapped to KeySyms instead of KeyCodes

   * Added a Cairo backend, although it is probably non-functional.
     Anyone is invited to contribute to making it work.

   * art backend supports reading from a window.

   * Add internal window decoration handling.

1.8 Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.3'
=========================================

   * A number of W32 window event enhancements

   * art backend glyph drawing with alpha enhancements.

   * libwraster is no longer checked for - image functions now in
     frontend

1.9 Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.2'
=========================================

   * Art backend added support for grayscale, one-isblack colorspaces.

   * Windows pasteboard interaction handling added.

   * Better focus handling on Windows.

   * Better font and draw handling on Windows.

1.10 Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.1'
==========================================

Color on 8 bit displays works correctly now. WindowMaker properties are
always set now in case another manager is emulating WindowMaker styles.

1.11 Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.0'
==========================================

Some more improvements to copy/paste support following ICCCM
specifications (like COMPOUND_TEXT support).

1.12 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.9'
==========================================

   * Much improved pasting support between X apps and GNUstep apps.

   * Backend headers are no longer installed (now private).

1.13 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.8'
==========================================

Full multi-byte/unicode support for East Asian languages was added to
the xlib backend. The X11 server now supports use of the XIM input
method for entering non-keyboard characters. Both contributions thanks
to Kazunobu Kuriyama.

   * Also added slightly better EWMH support.

   * Art backend works with more versions of freetype.

1.14 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.7'
==========================================

Handle NSBezierPath glyph drawing in art backend. art backend compiles
with all freetype except 2.1.3 via ifdefs.

1.15 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.6'
==========================================

Bug fixes. See the gnustep-gui NEWS for changes.

1.16 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.5'
==========================================

Text system improvements. See the gnustep-gui NEWS for changes.

1.17 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.3'
==========================================

See the gnustep-gui NEWS for changes.

1.18 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.2'
==========================================

Improved font handling in art backend. Improved compositing  with
transformations and clipping in art backend.

1.19 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.1'
==========================================

art (libart-based) backend added. Use ./configure -enable-graphics=art
to choose this backend.

1.20 Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.0'

Add -with-library-flags and -with-include-flags for adding additonal
flags. Set name with -with-name

1.23 Noteworthy changes in version `0.7.7'
==========================================

First release. Most components extracted from xgps. The old backends,
xgps and xdps were depreciated in favor of this new backend, simply
named back, which can be configured for a variety of window server and
graphics implementations, and also allow for improved code sharing.

   In addition there is now a window server backend for Windows
computers, although it is in a very alpha state.
