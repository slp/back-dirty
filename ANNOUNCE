This is version 0.10.1 of the GNUstep GUI Backend (`gnustep-back').

What is the GNUstep GUI Backend?
================================

It is a back-end component for the GNUstep GUI Library.  The
implementation of the GNUstep GUI Library is designed in two parts.  The
first part is the front-end component which is independent of platform
and display system.  This front-end is combined with a back-end
component which handles all of the display system dependent such as
specific calls to the X Window System.  This design allows the GNUstep
applications to have the "look and feel" of the underlying display
system without any changes to the application, and the library can be
easily ported to other display systems.

   The GNUstep GUI Backend is for platforms using the X-Window System or
Window's Systems. It works via a DPS emulation engine to emulate the
DPS functions required by the front-end system.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.10.1'
======================================

The art graphics module is the default now. As was previously the case,
if the proper libraries are not found, the configuration will
automatically switch to xlib on winlib (whichever is appropriate).

   There was a great deal of work by Tom MacSween on the windows module
to get windows and taskbars working together, closing, opening, hiding,
and just general good window management.

   The Cairo module has been significantly updated and now works with
Cariro version 1.0, although you need to make some minor changes to the
Cairo library before it will work with GNUstep. Due to this, this module
is still considered beta. Ask on the mailing lists for help with this.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

The gstep-back-0.10.1.tar.gz distribution file has been placed at
<ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/core>.

Where do I send bug reports?
============================

Bug reports can be sent to the GNUstep bug list <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>
