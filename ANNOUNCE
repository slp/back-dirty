This is version 0.9.4 of the GNUstep GUI Backend (`gnustep-back').

What is the GNUstep GUI Backend?
================================

It is a back-end component for the GNUstep GUI Library.  The
implementation of the GNUstep GUI Library is designed in two parts.  The
first part is the front-end component which is independent of platform
and display system.  This front-end is combined with a back-end
component which handles all of the display system dependent such as
specific calls to the X Window System.  This design allows the GNUstep
applications to have the "look and feel" of the underlying display
system without any changes to the application, and the library can be
easily ported to other display systems.

   The GNUstep GUI Backend is for platforms using the X-Window System or
Window's Systems. It works via a DPS emulation engine to emulate the
DPS functions required by the front-end system.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.4'
=====================================

   * Fast drawing on 8 bit displays was added (although it might only
     speed things up on old X11 servers and/or remote servers).

   * GNUstep modifier keys are mapped to KeySyms instead of KeyCodes

   * Added a Cairo backend, although it is probably non-functional.
     Anyone is invited to contribute to making it work.

   * art backend supports reading from a window.

   * Add internal window decoration handling.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

The gstep-back-0.9.4.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.

Where do I send bug reports?
============================

Bug reports can be sent to the GNUstep bug list <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>
