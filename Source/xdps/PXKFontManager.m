/* It would be probably more portable to use the standard PS resource
   enumerator functions, but the makepsres utility does not understand how
   DGS organize its resources. So we use the below techniques to identify
   the font and AFM files.

   For Adobe DPS implementations I use the PS resources because it's more
   portable.
