@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.7.8}

Simplified backend selection using --enable-server and
--enable-graphics. Add --with-library-flags and --with-include-flags
for adding additonal flags. Set name with --with-name

@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.7.7}

First release. Most components extracted from xgps. The old backends,
xgps and xdps were depreciated in favor of this new backend, simply named
back, which can be configured for a variety of window server and
graphics implementations, and also allow for improved code sharing.

In addition there is now a window server backend for Windows computers, 
although it is in a very alpha state.
