      <heading>Defaults Summary</heading>
      <p>
        This document contains a summary of available user default
        values that one can set to control the operation of the GNUstep
        backend.
      </p>
      <section>
        <heading>Backend Defaults</heading>
      <p>
      Below is a list of defaults used to control the x11-based
      backend. These defaults generally control system specific
      display and user interaction options which may not be available
      on all systems.
      </p>
	<deflist>
	  <term>NSDefaultVisual</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
          An integer that specifies the X-Windows visual class to use
          in the application. For instance one could display the
          application using the PsuedoColor visual class by setting
          the value to the id of this class. The default is the
          X-Windows default visual class.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>NSColorsPerChannel</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
          An integer which limits the maximum number of colors to
          display, per channel. For a psuedo-color display, this would
          limit the total number of colors that the application could
          use (normally 256). For a true-color display, this would
          limit the range of red, green, and blue values that could be used.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSAppOwnsMiniwindow</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
	  GSAppOwnsMiniwindow is for miniwindows (not app icons). If
	  it's YES or absent, GNUstep handles miniaturization itself
	  and doesn't let the window manager do it. If it's NO, the
	  window manager is allowed to do its own iconification. This
	  does not affect app icons at all.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSFontAntiAlias</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
          With the xlib backend, this is a boolean value which
          defaults to <code>YES</code>. If set to
          <code>YES</code> and X Windows system has the XFT
          extension, then the application will use anti-aliased fonts
          as provided by XFT. If set to <code>NO</code> anti-aliased fonts
	  will not be used even when available.
          </p>
	  <p> With the art backend, A boolean value which defaults to
	  YES. If YES, text is anti-aliased at small sizes (9-16
	  pixels). The value is advisory (specific fonts can override this
	  setting).
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSFontMask</term>
	  <desc>
          <p> [Xlib backend only]
          A string value which defaults to <code>"*"</code>. It defines
          the pattern used to get the installed fonts from the
          X-Server. A value of <code>"*-iso8859-1"</code> would only
          include fonts available with ISO Western encoding. This
          feature might be helpfull if the font_cacher program is having
          problem with the X-Server.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSUseWMTaskBar</term>
	  <desc>
          <p> [W32 backend only]
          A string value which defaults to <code>YES</code>. If enabled, the
	  backend assumes that miniwindows are displayed in a task bar. In
	  this case, the app icon is not shown and the main menu behavior
	  is changed so it is not ordered out, but minimized, so clicking
	  on the minimized menu will activate the application.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSXEnableFontSet</term>
	  <desc>
          <p> A string value which defaults to <code>NO</code>. If set to
	  <code>YES</code>, then the backend font classes will support
	  full multi-byte/unicode characters. This is useful for using
	  many East Asian languages. However, the respose of the GUI is
	  somwhat slower when this is enabled.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSXIMInputMethodStyle</term>
	  <desc>
          <p> A string value used to specify the XIM input method for
	  entering characters. Valid values are
	  <code>RootWindow</code>, <code>OffTheSpot</code>, or
	  <code>OverTheSpot</code>.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSX11HandlesWindowDecorations</term>
	  <desc>
	  <p> [X11-based backends only]
	  A boolean value, by default <code>YES</code>, which indicates if
	  the backend should let the window manager handle window
	  decorations. When set to <code>NO</code>, GNUstep-GUI will handle
	  the window decorations, which is particularly useful if you aren't
	  running any window manager.
	  </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GraphicCompositing</term>
	  <desc>
          <p> [Xlib backend only]
          A boolean value which defaults to <code>YES</code>. If set to
          <code>YES</code>, then the application uses various tricks
          to get alpha colors to work when compositing images. This
          may slow down drawing of images, but it is generally
          recommended anyway, particularly on fast systems.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>Fast Drawing on 8-bit Displays</term>
	  <desc>
          <p> [X11-based backends only]
	  This is not a user default, but if you are using an 8-bit display
	  and you define the standard X11 <code>BEST</code> colormap (via
	  <code>xstdcmap -best</code>), then GNUstep will use this colormap
	  and enable faster drawing onto 8-bit displays.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>Keyboard Modifiers</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
          The OPENstep specification requires three main different
          keyboard modifiers: <code>CONTROL</code>,
          <code>COMMAND</code> and <code>ALTERNATE</code> as well as
	  the <code>HELP</code> modifier for context help. Some systems
          may not have these set up correctly. You can changed the defaults
          with the default keys.
          </p>
           <list>
	      <item>GSFirstControlKey</item>
	      <item>GSSecondControlKey</item>
	      <item>GSFirstCommandKey</item>
	      <item>GSSecondCommandKey</item>
	      <item>GSFirstAlternateKey</item>
	      <item>GSSecondAlternateKey</item>
	      <item>GSFirstHelpKey</item>
	      <item>GSSecondHelpKey</item>
	    </list>
          <p>
          Default values are respectively:
          </p>
           <list>
	      <item>Control_L</item>
	      <item>Control_R</item>
	      <item>Alt_L</item>
	      <item>NoSymbol</item>
	      <item>Alt_R</item>
	      <item>NoSymbol</item>
	      <item>Help</item>
	      <item>Super_L</item>
	    </list>
          <p>
          These strings correspond to "keysyms" on X11 systems.  On X11,
          physical keys on the keyboard are equivalent to <em>keycodes</em>.
          A single keysym may be associated to more than one keycode, and
          can even be associated to a shifted key.
          </p>
          <p>
          This is described more completely in the <uref
          url="../../../User/Gui/KeyboardSetup.html">GUI documentation on
          keyboard setup</uref>.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSModifiersAreKeys</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
          On some keyboards, the default X11 mapping includes keycodes that
          are mapped to one or another modifier keysym depending on whether
          'shift' (or in some cases, another key) is pressed.  This is the
          case on some Apple USB keyboards for example: one key to the left
          of the spacebar maps to "Option" without shift pressed, and "Alt"
          with shift pressed.  Such keyboard mappings are often useful in
          non-English contexts to access accents or non-Roman characters.
          However if such a key is used as a modifier in GNUstep problems can
          occur when trying to use the modifier in conjunction with a shifted
          character.  In particular, you will need to hit and release the
          modifier and the shift key in a particular order, or else things
          will not work as expected, and the modifier may become "stuck".  If
          you experience such a problem, set <code>GSModifiersAreKeys</code>
          to <code>YES</code>.

	  <term>UseWindowMakerIcons</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
	  UseWindowMakerIcons is for app icons, and has no effect when
	  the window manager isn't Window Maker. It displays the
	  application's icon window in the window Window Maker
	  provides instead of creating one controlled by the app. This
	  allows the icon to be docked.  It is a boolean value which
	  defaults to <code>YES</code>.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>XGPS-Shm</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>
          A boolean value which defaults to <code>YES</code> (as long as shared
          memory is available). If set to <code>NO</code>, shared memory is not
          used for various display specific operations.
          </p>
	  </desc>
	  <term>GSOldClipboard</term>
	  <desc>
          <p>[X backends only]
          A boolean value which defaults to <code>NO</code>. If set to YES the
	  old GNUstep way of X clipboard interaction will be used. That is
	  PRIMARY as the general pasteboard and CLIPBOARD for the
	  selection. Whereas the new X standard is the other way around. This
	  setting may be needed for interaction in an old X enviornment.
