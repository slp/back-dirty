    <p>

        This document describes how various system and user actions
	affect window focus of GNUstep applications. This document describes
	focus changes that occur outside of application control, since
	application focus changes are well described in the class 
	documentation.
          </p>

            <h2><a name="001001000000">Application Focus</a></h2>
    <p>

      The application can get focus in several ways.
          </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Launch from the command line or another app
      </li>
      <li>
        Another app looses focus (e.g. by terminating)
      </li>
      <li>
        Users switches screens to the one the app is displayed on
      </li>
      <li>
        Double-click on the application icon
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      The first case does not directly affect window focus (because there
      are no windows at startup). However, as the application begins to
      create an order front windows (including the main menu) there will
      likely be a cascade of focus events generated by the window manager.
          </p>
    <p>

      In the second and third case, the window manager will likely try
      to give focus to the window that previously had it or perhaps to some
      random window based on some internal window manager
      code. GNUstep may ignore this and try to give focus to another
      window.
          </p>
    <p>

      The last case is handled mostly in the GUI front-end.
          </p>

            <h2><a name="001002000000">KeyboardFocus</a></h2>
    <p>

      The Key window is the window that has keyboard focus and has
      keyboard events sent to it.  When an application is launched, in
      many cases, only the application icon and main menu may be
      displayed. In the OpenStep interface, neither of these is really
      supposed to be a key window, and in fact, many window managers
      control the application icon so this cannot be made key
      anyway. In X-Windows, however, there is no other way for an
      application to receive keyboard events unless a visible window
      has been made key. This leaves the main menu.
          </p>
    <p>

      When an application receives focus, or if all the windows in an
      application are closed (see [NSWindow-_lossOfKeyOrMainWindow]),
      then the main menu should get keyboard focus. This is handled in
      the gui frontend, so there should be nothing special done in the
      backend to support this.
          </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>WindowMaker</dt>
      <dd>
        
	
        <p>

	WindowMaker controls the application icon so it does not
	receive  keyboard events
	        </p>
        
	
      </dd>
    </dl>

            <h2><a name="001003000000">Requesting Keyboard Focus</a></h2>
    <p>

      A window may request to get keyboard focus in serveral
      instances. If the window asks or is asked to become key, through
      the [NSWindow-becomeKeyWindow] method, it will send a
      setinputfocus: message to the server.
          </p>
    <p>

      If the window is ordered front and the window is the key window,
      it will send a setinputfocus: message.
          </p>
    <p>

      If during _lossOfKeyOrMainWindow, only the main menu is able to
      become key, it will sent a setinputfoucs: message.
          </p>

            <h2><a name="001004000000">Window Focus In/Out</a></h2>
    <p>

      The GUI front-end receives two types of focus events from the
      back-end (through an NSEvent object). Both of these are subsets
      of the NSAppKitDefined event: GSAppKitWindowFocusIn and
      GSAppKitWindowFocusOut. Each contains a pointer to the window
      that should be focused. A focus in event can be received for
      several reasons:
          </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The window manager deminiaturized the window. The WM
        should really tell the application to do this itself, but many
        WM don't. In this case the window just posts a notification
        that it happened. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The application is in the process of hidding. As each
	window is ordered out, the WM may send a focus message
	(spuriously) to the next window in line. In this case the
	message is just ignored. 
      </li>
      <li>
        This is a real focus in message. The window checks if it
	can become key or main and activates the application if it is
	not active. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If this window is the main menu, it looks for another
	window to become the key window, if possible, through the
	_lossOfKeyOrMainWindow mechanism
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      The front-end does nothing for FocusOut messages.
          </p>

            <h2><a name="001005000000">X-Windows messages</a></h2>
    <p>

      This section describes messages that X-Windows servers and WM
      generally send to the application.
          </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Take Focus</dt>
      <dd>
        
	
        <p>

	A message from the WM telling a window it should take
	keyboard focus. The back-end should only send a FocusIn event
	to the front end if the window asked to be key (and isn't
	already) or through a user action, such as a click on the
	title bar. The back-end may also send an event if the window
	has just been mapped, although this is not typically
	necessary, unless it's due to a screen change.
	        </p>
        
	
      </dd>
      <dt>Focus In</dt>
      <dd>
        
	
        <p>

	A message from the server telling the application that
	keyboard focus has been set for a window. The back-end
	should not send an event to the front-end in this
	case. However, the back-end should use this information to
	determine when to send a message in other cases (e.g. from a
	Take Focus message).
	        </p>
        
	
      </dd>
      <dt>Focus Out</dt>
      <dd>
        
	
        <p>

	A message from the server telling the application that focus
	has left a window. If the focus has gone to a window that is
	not part of the application, the back-end should tell the
	NSApp to deactivate. Otherwise it should do nothing.
	        </p>
        
	
      </dd>
